# FitnessHelper

This is a very interesting GUI application. It was made using pyqt5. It is basically a fitness helper to help you do HIIT workout. Which is short for High Intensity Interval Training.
This project has 13 drills and also has a good UI. YOU can change the duration of each drill, change the break between each drill and also see pictures on how to do the drill on the 
right hand side
